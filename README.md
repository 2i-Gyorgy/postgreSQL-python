In this project I experiment working with PostgreSQL and Python.
A docker image should help me tu create a local database.

to get the database up and running:
docker-compose up

all the python code is from: https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/tutorial-postgresql-python
requirements for pyPostgresTest.py
pip install psycopg2
